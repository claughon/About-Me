                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Back in the mid 1990s, I was born in small town Wyoming, the state, not the town in Michigan. I was born into a steriotypical Wyoming rancher family. My family had 40 acres of land and countless animals throughout my childhood. I grew up riding horses, rodeoing, roping cows,
                    branding and moving cows every summer. In the winters, I was tasked with milking our two milk cows before school and bottle feeding any bum calves. I raised sheep and steers for 4H every year so that I could spend a week at our county fair showing my livestock before getting to 
                    sell them at a live auction. I also grew up playing ice hockey and got to travel all over the western United States and some of the midwest playing in tournaments and going to development camps. I played all the way through my senior year with the boys hockey team because there was 
                    not a girls team. We won the state hockey title my senior year after three years of finishing in second place. I took up golf in the 8th, grade and played varsity golf all throughout highschool, where senior year my school one the girls' state title and I finished third. I then attended
                    the University of Wyoming where I majored in kinesiology and health promotion and minored in human systems physiology, I was on track to go to medical school. My senior year of college I decided that medical school was not for me and moved to Washington state with my girlfriend. 
                    I worked at a cabinet factory, a tire shop and a fencing company while living there. I proposed to my girlfriend in 2019 and we began planning a wedding for July of 2020. You can guess how that ended up, we still got married that year but it looked a lot different than either one of 
                    us expected. My wife, was then accepted into the Physician Associate program at Duke, and we moved to Durham, North Carolina in the middle of the hottest, most humid summer, I have ever experienced in my entire life. She just recently finished her first year and is now getting ready to 
                    start her year of rotations, the same day that I start the software development program. We currently have one dog, Dilbert who is half pug, half daucschund. I think he probably got the best traits of those two particular breeds. He has adjusted fairly well to the heat and humidity but does
                    prefer a quality air conditioning system.</p>

                <h1>Why Software Development</h1>
                <p>Growing up in a fairly rural setting, with so many chores to do, I did not grow up with the latest and greatest technology. In fact, my family did not get a computer until I was in the 8th grade, and my family did not get a gaming console until I was in highschool. The house I grew up in still doesn't 
                    have internet, except through satellite, because no one has bothered to get any out to where we lived. So all that to say, technology has only recently become a big part of my life. I got into console gaming when I went to college because I had my own TV and gaming console to use whenever I wanted. At one of 
                    my previous jobs a lot of the guys I worked with were into PC gaming and that is where I started to hear about graphics cards and all kinds of crazy upgrades they were doing to their computers. This actually piqued my interest even more into the tech space but I got busy with life and planning a wedding and I
                    pushed my interests to the backburner. Eventually, I ended up moving to North Carolina with no job and a choice. I began researching jobs in tech and how the best way to break into that space was. I eventually stumblled upon a website that offered videos lessons on coding in various languages and got
                    even more interested in how I could possible make the switch from a degree in health science and a recent job repitoure of manual labor jobs and carve my way into software development. However, bills began to pile up and I ended up taking another manual labor job. I began to watch free coding videos and trying
                    to make sure that becoming a software developer was the right career course for me. When it finally clicked for me that pursuing a career in tech was the right choice for me. My friend, Joe and I were chatting on a hike and we were talking about our jobs and I found out that he was a software developer.
                    So we started discussing what coding languages he was working with and what he was doing for his company. As we were talking, he asked me, 'It sounds like you know more than I do about my job.' I told him that I had a growing interest in the subject and had just been poking around the internet. I told him
                    about my reservations and he told me that I should go for it. So over the last year, I have worked very hard to come to this exact moment, where I have the ability to fully dive into this software development program, which will hopefully propel me into a career that I find challenging, collaborative
                    and fulfilling.</p>

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>Outside of work, or school now, I like to play ice hockey. I am currently on a women's team and it is amazing to play with ladies who have come to the sport later in their lives. It makes playing a lot more fun and a little less competitive than the hockey I was used to playing. We share lots of laughs 
                    as they develop their skills. Plus, I get to try and help them score a goal, sometimes for the first time! I have recently began to swim for exercise. I don't have a lot of experience with swimming, and it has been interesting trying to not drown while I am doing it. I also have joined a running club since moving
                    to North Carolina, my highschool self would be impressed because I used to hate running with a passion and now I find it kind of relaxing. I also love taking Dilbert on walks and he enjoys going, even if it is the same lap around our neighborhood that he has taken hundreds of times. I also enjoy playing 
                    COD and any of the NHL versions on the xbox. My wife and I play at least one round of undercooked per night before bed, it is one of the most satisfying yet frustrating cooperative games that I have ever played in my life. I also love to read and listen to audiobooks, I love most genres and am always willing
                    to take recommendations.
